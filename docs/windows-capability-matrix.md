# Windows Capability Matrix

Maps current official Ghostty docs surfaces to noctty behavior on
Windows. Cells stay short; rows with real nuance point into the
[Notes](#notes) section below. Update rows when Windows behavior changes or
when upstream docs add or remove a surface that this fork cares about.

Last reviewed: 2026-09-02.

## Status legend

- `supported` — works on current Windows builds and matches upstream docs
  closely enough to rely on them.
- `partial` — some of the surface works, but Windows behavior is narrower,
  differently scoped, or still filling in.
- `windows-specific` — added or materially changed by this fork; upstream
  Ghostty docs do not describe it accurately yet.

| [Shell integration](https://ghostty.org/docs/features/shell-integration)                     | Upstream shell docs apply; Windows adds PowerShell injection and `cmd.exe` prompt/cwd marks. Clink is required for cmd command-finish marks and exit codes. See [shell integration notes](#shell-integration).                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Action reference](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind/reference)                        | Shared action grammar is intact, but upstream mixes in macOS/Linux behavior. For Windows truth, prefer `+show-config --default --docs` plus `+list-keybinds`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [Configuration: `auto-update`](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference)                    | Stable-release checking and prompts backed by GitHub Releases. `download` stages installer releases after SHA-256 and Authenticode verification; portable ZIP staging/apply additionally requires a pinned-publisher-signed manifest covering every payload file and otherwise stays on the release-page path. Apply is user-initiated. See [windows.md](windows.md#updates). |
| [Configuration: `window-save-state`](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference)              | Persists windows, tabs, splits, profiles, working directories, and titles under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\session-state.json`. `window-save-state-scrollback` opts in to bounded plain-text pane snapshots; child processes are not restored.                                                                                                                                    |

| [Features overview](https://ghostty.org/docs/features)                                       | Accessibility is partial: UI Automation covers the daily chrome and terminal text, but caption buttons, overlay rows, and menus are uncovered. Only NVDA has been measured, with mixed results.

| [Configuration: `link-previews`](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference)                  | Link matching, highlighting, and opening work, but the Win32 runtime does not render the preview tooltip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Configuration: `key-remap`](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference)                      | Focused and in-app keybinds plus terminal encoding honor remaps; `global:` hotkeys keep the literal configured chord.

## Notes

### ConPTY transport

Packaged builds prefer the side-by-side ConPTY redistributable and fall back to
the in-box conhost with a warning. `+version` and the diagnostic-bundle manifest
report the active source. On this machine the bundled source delivered measured
Kitty APC and Sixel DCS payloads byte-for-byte; the in-box source dropped both.
See the generation-specific
[transport catalog](windows-vt-conformance.md#conpty-transport-generations-and-mangling-catalog).

### Shell integration

Upstream docs for automatic `bash` / `elvish` / `fish` / `nushell` / `zsh`
injection still apply when those shells are launched on Windows. On top of
that:

- Automatic PowerShell injection (`powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`), with a
  manual fallback at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\shell-integration\powershell\integration.ps1`.
- PowerShell emits OSC 7 cwd URIs, OSC 133 prompt marks, command-finish
  status, and PSReadLine command metadata when available.
- OSC 133 prompt marks back previous/next prompt navigation, copying the last
  completed command output, and inserting the last recoverable single-line
  command back on the prompt from the command palette. Insert requires
  OSC 133;B and OSC 133;C and a B mark that noctty has not itself submitted
  with Enter since; it does not inspect or modify the shell's line editor, and
  it does not submit the command — OSC 133 marks are forgeable by any program
  writing to the terminal, so the user reviews and presses Enter.
- PowerShell wraps `ssh` for `ssh-env` and cache-aware `ssh-terminfo`, but
  does not auto-install remote terminfo; uncached hosts use
  `xterm-256color`.
- Automatic `cmd.exe` integration wraps the existing `PROMPT` (or cmd's
  `$P$G` default) to emit OSC 133 A/B prompt marks and OSC 9;9 cwd reports.
  When Clink is detected, noctty prepends its shipped Lua directory to
  `CLINK_PATH`; an already-active Clink can then load it and emit OSC 133 C/D
  command marks and exit codes. Noctty does not activate Clink. Without the
  loaded Clink script, prompt/cwd marks still work but command-finish marks and
  exit codes are unavailable.

### Keyboard input

The Win32 path supplies press, repeat, and release events to the shared Kitty
encoder, with Caps Lock, Num Lock, and left/right modifier state on every
physical event. While a client has Kitty `report_all` enabled, ordinary keys
carry their text on the physical event instead of the `WM_CHAR` commit, so
press and release keep one identity; AltGr chords ride the same path with the
synthetic Ctrl+Alt collapsed, a dead key stays composing until its composed
character arrives, and a dead key that cannot combine delivers both
characters. IME commits remain text without a physical key. These paths have
unit coverage but have not been exercised on a real non-US keyboard.

Kitty and modifyOtherKeys encodings survive the pseudo console byte for byte
on the two sources measured here — the in-box conhost of Windows
`10.0.26200.0` and the bundled OpenConsole `1.24.260710001`; older in-box
conhosts are unmeasured. noctty does not implement Win32 input mode
(`CSI ?9001h`), which ConPTY requests at the start of every session. See the
[key encoding differential](windows-vt-conformance.md#measured-master-to-child-key-encoding-differential).

`key-remap` changes modifier state before focused or in-app keybind matching
and terminal encoding; it does not change physical key identity. `global:`
bindings register the literal configured chord through `RegisterHotKey`, so
remaps do not retarget system-wide hotkeys.

### Accessibility

The Win32 host exposes a UI Automation root provider; tabs, the new-tab and
overflow buttons, docked-search controls, the search result count, host
banners, and the terminal scrollbar expose per-widget providers with the
patterns their roles require; the command palette and settings sections
expose list and selection semantics; and terminal text is available through
`ITextProvider` / `ITextRangeProvider` / `ITextProvider2` including real
selections. Caption buttons, overlay rows, menus, and toasts are still
uncovered. Only NVDA has been measured, on a pre-release branch build,
and several chrome elements do not announce their role or state through
it — see the [screen-reader matrix](accessibility-matrix.md).

### Renderer

Terminal presentation is owned by WGL `SwapBuffers`. A separate
D3D11/DirectComposition shell pipeline owns recoverable top-level targets and
transparent DPI-sized D2D surfaces; host banner and operation text is the
first DirectWrite production zone, with per-paint GDI fallback. That pipeline
does not replace or call the terminal renderer. The terminal path has a hard
OpenGL 4.3-via-WGL floor and no software fallback; below it, noctty shows a
startup diagnostic naming the detected version and does not launch.

### Universal palette

Configurable actions, live tabs, panes, Windows profiles, installed themes,
native settings, reviewed help destinations, and keyboard tab-to-pane moves
share one typed, fuzzy-ranked list with:

- category prefixes (`>`, `@`, `/`, `~`, `:`, `%`, `!`, `?`) and keyboard
  navigation
- stable dispatch IDs and destructive/disabled semantics
- UI Automation selection announcements
- reversible live theme preview before commit (High Contrast suppresses
  cosmetic previews but still allows an explicit commit)
- a snapshot-validated recent-action provider

### Native settings

Appearance, Terminal, Shell, Privacy, Updates, Keybindings, and Advanced
sections ship. Edits are staged until Save and applied through an atomic,
source-preserving config patch; Advanced shows the pending field diff and
keeps the plain-text escape hatch. Owned snapshots survive external reloads,
and native fields support reversible live preview, revision-aware
external-edit merging, and explicit Keep mine / Use disk conflict
resolution. Keybinding editing still uses the text config and CLI discovery
commands.

### Tab dragging

Same-window reorder and DPI-aware exact-pane drag-to-split ship, with
operation-labeled drop previews. Transfers move the complete source split
subtree through one authoritative ShellState/native transaction, and undo /
redo restore exact tab, pane, split-tree, ratio, and focus identity. The
universal palette provides the equivalent keyboard workflow. Cross-window
OLE transfer is not shipped.

### Quick terminal

No default keybind. Bind `toggle_quick_terminal`; add the `global:` prefix
for a system-wide hotkey while noctty is running. Windows can reject a
reserved or conflicting trigger. Position, size, monitor, animation,
autohide, and focus behavior are configurable. `exclusive` maps to focused
input, and `quick-terminal-space-behavior` has no Windows effect.

### Notifications and progress

WinRT toasts use noctty's AppUserModelID and fall back to a host banner, then
the log, when native delivery fails. `desktop-notifications` gates every
toast. Command-finish toasts additionally need `notify-on-command-finish` and
a `notify-on-command-finish-action` that includes `notify`; they are the only
toasts that carry a launch argument, so only they focus the originating pane
when clicked. OSC 9 / OSC 777 toasts are display-only. Reliable cold-start
activation depends on the installed Start menu shortcut.
`notify-on-command-finish-after` and the focus policy are applied before the
bell or toast; command marks come from shell integration or OSC 133, which
`cmd.exe` does not supply.

With `progress-style = true`, terminal progress reports map to normal, paused,
error, or indeterminate taskbar states for the active pane in each host. If
the taskbar COM interface fails, noctty disables the native indicator.

### Search and scrollbars

`Ctrl+Shift+F` opens search for the focused pane. Search state and controls
are per pane; results can mark the graphical scrollbar. `scrollbar = system`
respects Windows' dynamic-scrollbar preference and stays visible in High
Contrast; `never` removes only the visual widget.

### Clipboard and drag-drop

`clipboard-paste-protection` controls confirmation for unsafe clipboard
pastes and the stricter dropped-payload classifier. The confirmation shows the
payload it is about in a read-only monospace pane, capped at 64 KiB of display
(the full payload is still what Accept delivers). The payload is shown as it is,
matching upstream Ghostty's GTK and macOS dialogs; only invalid UTF-8 and NUL
are replaced with U+FFFD, because neither survives the trip to a Win32 EDIT.
CF_HTML copies also place a plain-text fallback on the clipboard. Dropped files, text, URLs, and HTML
are converted to terminal input. Shift changes file/text handling, Ctrl
suppresses file-path quoting, and Alt is reserved.

`clipboard-codepoint-map` is applied by the shared selection formatter before
plain, VT, or HTML bytes reach the clipboard. Clipboard reads, URL copies,
OSC 52 writes, and `write_screen_file` exports are not mapped.

### Child-process limits

The retained `linux-cgroup`, `linux-cgroup-memory-limit`,
`linux-cgroup-processes-limit`, and `linux-cgroup-hard-fail` keys opt
Windows-local launches into Job Object enforcement. Off by default;
best-effort failures continue without limits unless hard-fail is set.
`windows-job-object-kill-on-close` is also opt-in. WSL launches are excluded.
