# Getting started

noctty runs on Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or newer and Windows 11,
x64 and ARM64, and needs a GPU driver with OpenGL 4.3 or newer.

## Install with Scoop

The WinGet package is pending bootstrap. Scoop uses the same release assets
and checksums and puts `noctty` on PATH:

```powershell
scoop bucket add noctty https://github.com/amanthanvi/scoop-noctty
scoop install noctty/noctty
```

Then skip to [First launch](#first-launch).

## Install by hand

The current stable release is `1.3.127`. Every release ships these files for
`<arch>` = `x64` and `arm64`:

| File                                                    | What it is                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-setup.exe`             | Installer                         |
| `noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-portable.zip`          | Portable build                    |
| `noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-portable.manifest.ps1` | Signed hashes of the ZIP contents |
| `SHA256SUMS-windows-<arch>.txt`                         | Checksums for the files above     |

Hash the file you downloaded before you run it, whichever one that is:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
Get-FileHash .\noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-portable.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the result with the matching line in `SHA256SUMS-windows-<arch>.txt`.
On a mismatch, delete the file and download it again. Provenance and signature
checks are in [verify-release.md](verify-release.md).

### Installer

1. Run `noctty-<version>-windows-<arch>-setup.exe`.
2. If SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then
   **Run anyway**.
3. Accept the MIT license and install.
4. Launch noctty from the Start menu.

### Portable

Extract the ZIP anywhere and run `noctty.exe`. SmartScreen may warn here too.
Keep the folder together: `noctty.exe` needs the `share` folder next to it for
themes, terminfo, and shell integration. `.\noctty.com +register-shell-menu`
adds an "Open noctty here" entry to Explorer's right-click menu.

Keep the extracted folder together: `noctty.exe` needs the `share` folder
beside it for themes, terminfo, and shell integration.

To keep config, state, and cache in that folder too, create an empty
`noctty.portable` file beside `noctty.exe`; extraction alone does not enable
portable mode. `portable.txt` and an existing `config.ghostty` regular file
are also recognized markers; directories are not.

Neither install adds `noctty` to PATH. The `noctty +...` commands below assume
you added the install folder to PATH or are running from it.

### About the SmartScreen warning

The installer, the manifest, and the binaries inside the portable ZIP are
Authenticode-signed with a self-signed certificate. That certificate has no
publisher reputation, so SmartScreen warns on first run, and the warning does
not fade with time. What each check proves, and the publisher key the updater
pins, are in [verify-release.md](verify-release.md).

## First launch

noctty creates `%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\` and writes a config template to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\config.ghostty`. In portable mode it uses
`config.ghostty` beside `noctty.exe` instead, and the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` copy is
ignored. It picks a default shell for you; see [Shell](#shell) to change it.

## Font and theme

Open the config with `notepad "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\noctty\config.ghostty"` (or
the `config.ghostty` beside `noctty.exe` in portable mode) and add a few
options:

```ini
font-family = JetBrains Mono
font-size   = 12
# Pick a theme from: noctty +list-themes
# Theme files are config files; only use themes from sources you trust.
theme       = Dracula
```

`noctty +list-fonts` shows a family whose typographic name differs from the
name Windows registers as `Legacy (Typographic)`, for example
`JetBrainsMono NFM (JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono)`; `font-family` accepts
either name.

Save, then press `Ctrl+Shift+,` to reload without restarting.
`noctty +show-config --default --docs | more` lists every option with its
docs, including the keybind grammar.

## Keybindings

Defaults are Ctrl chords, mostly the same as Ghostty's non-macOS defaults.
Pane focus on `Alt+Arrow` is Windows-specific.

| Action                   | Binding                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Copy                     | `Ctrl+Shift+C`                |
| Paste                    | `Ctrl+Shift+V`                |
| New tab                  | `Ctrl+Shift+T`                |
| Close tab                | `Ctrl+Shift+W`                |
| Next / previous tab      | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` |
| Split pane right         | `Ctrl+Shift+\`                |
| Split pane down          | `Ctrl+Shift+E`                |
| Move between panes       | `Alt+Arrow`                   |
| Command palette          | `Ctrl+Shift+P`                |
| Quick select             | `Ctrl+Shift+Space`            |
| Copy mode                | `Ctrl+Shift+X`                |
| Start search             | `Ctrl+Shift+F`                |
| Increase / decrease font | `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-`           |
| Reload config            | `Ctrl+Shift+,`                |

`noctty +list-keybinds` prints the full list. `Ctrl+Shift+O` also splits
right; the docs use `Ctrl+Shift+\` because Narrator can reserve O-based
commands. Rebind with `keybind = <trigger>=<action>`:

```ini
keybind = ctrl+t=new_tab
keybind = ctrl+shift+r=reload_config
```

## Shell

noctty detects PowerShell, cmd, Git Bash, and WSL distributions and lists them
in the profile picker. To pin one as the default:

```ini
command = pwsh.exe
```

Any name on PATH works. A plain value goes through `cmd.exe /C`, which stops
reading at the first space, so a full path with spaces needs the `direct:`
form and quotes:

```ini
command = direct:"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

WSL shows up in the picker but is never the default unless you set
`command = wsl.exe`. More on shells in [windows.md](windows.md#shells).

## Updates

noctty checks GitHub Releases on launch, at most once every 24 hours, and
never installs anything until you start it. `auto-update = off` disables the
check. `auto-update = download` also downloads and verifies the installer
ahead of time; you still choose when to install. Details are in
[windows.md](windows.md#updates).

## If something goes wrong

If a broken config or saved session blocks launch, start once with built-in
defaults and no session restore:

```powershell
noctty --safe-mode
```

Crash dumps stay local under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\crash`; read them with
`noctty +crash-report`. Recovery and diagnostic bundles are in
[windows.md](windows.md#crash-reports-and-diagnostics).

## Uninstall

Installer builds: Settings, Apps, Installed apps, noctty, Uninstall. Portable
builds: run `.\noctty.com +unregister-shell-menu` if you registered the
Explorer entry, then delete the folder. Neither removes
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\noctty\`; delete it yourself for a clean slate.
